0,"December 27, 2017",Went here twice on the same weekend,5,"This was our 2nd set of visits to The Steak House; we were here the last time we visited Wellsboro for one of their festival weekends. Great Food and sitting at the bar--only a few seats though--is a nice experience. Clientele/staff is friendly; Chris, the hostess, and Geoff, the bartender contribute to the friendly atmosphere...both owners, I believe. Local color at the bar. If you like bourbon, ask Geoff to make you his ""smoker"". Filet and prime rib were nicely prepared. Lunch during the Dicken's Festival was from a limited menu, but also very good. We will return every time we are in Wellsboro.",549578126,604
1,"December 24, 2017",A Great Place to Eat on Main Street,5,"I've lived in Wellsboro for almost 10 years. We went to The Steakhouse when we first moved here and were not impressed. A couple of years ago, we ""rediscovered"" The Steakhouse, and I'm glad we did because now it's one of our favorite places. We can't ever seem to resist ordering the Drunken Pig Burger. The aged cheddar and candied-bacon on the juicy burger are amazing! I have enjoyed the scallops and the crab cakes. The kids menu is one of the most extensive around - much more than your typical chicken fingers and fries (during First Fridays in Wellsboro, kids eat FREE for each paying adult, it's an awesome deal for our family of four). To cap off the dinner, be sure to make room for their homemade pies! They are delicious, and if we're too full, we take it to go.",549086396,774

13,"October 5, 2017",Outstanding!,5,"Found ourselves in Westboro on a motorcycle trip thru PA. Went to TA to find a good restaurant near our hotel. The Steak House was a block away. Sold.

Our expectations were high going in and they were exceeded for food and service. Two out of 4 chose the filet mignon tips. I believe they were a special that night. They were outstanding. Cooked to perfection and portions were substantial, even for 4 hungry old guys. No room for dessert but we had some anyway. Ya, all excellent too.

Service was excellent as well. Felt like we were in someone's home. Waitress was top-notch. Lots of advice and lots of laughs. She even helped with directions for our next leg of our trip in the morning.

So good, we plan to make it a destination on our next trip. Well Done Steak House!!",530348097,776
14,"October 3, 2017",Expecting the BEST,5,"We had dinner reservations scheduled for 7 p.m. after arriving for a two night visit to Wellsboro. The Steakhouse came highly recommended--and since it was the STEAK house we two men ordered a filet, while the two women ordered a seafood dish. The steaks were tender, but, in my opinion, lacked FLAVOR. Not what I expected in a Filet Mignon --otherwise the meal was OK...not great, but OK",529697591,388
15,"September 26, 2017","Great food, awesome service!",4,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and decided to eat here for dinner. The food was absolutely delicious and our waitress was SO kind and helpful! We literally could not believe what great service they had. We were with both our small kids and after driving in the car for 6 hours, they were quite cranky and tired. But all the staff there were amazing and gave us tons of things to keep our kids occupied. The food came out in a timely manner and was AWESOME!! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!",527585617,514

17,"September 21, 2017",Outstanding,5,"The Steak House was close to our hotel so we gave it a shot. It was my husband's birthday, I was really hoping for a meal he would enjoy. He ordered steak and a crab cake (we're from Maryland, so getting a crab cake anywhere else is risky) and was very happy! Steak was so much better than steak house restaurant chains! I was concerned about the service when we entered, seemed a little disorganized, but once we were seated, our waitress was wonderful. Very happy, will definitely be back!",526375307,491
18,"September 21, 2017",OK,3,"Ate dinner here on a Wednesday night as we were staying overnight at a nearby Hotel. Very limited Restaurant choices otherwise, so this place was very busy.

21,"August 31, 2017",Try the salmon!,5,"Came here on vacation with my husband and yes, we are those people who ordered salmon at a steak house. I had the salmon salad, which was one of the best I ever had. A generous portion of salmon over spinach, with goat cheese and pine nuts - amazing! Hubby had salmon, baked potato and a side salad. We both tried the homemade pies for dessert and were not disappointed. Our server was very friendly and helpful! We would definitely return on our next trip to Wellsboro.",520094841,470
22,"August 27, 2017",Great food and that service,5,"My wife and I visited this place two days in a row with a number of friends while on a motorcycle trip. The meals where excellent and the desserts heavenly. The best part was our ""new"" waitress Carolyn :). She had a sense of humor that meshed 100% with our group! The first night we did a full dinner and second just desert (you want to branch out when on vacation after all). Everyone in our group would go back given the chance.",518188731,430

24,"August 22, 2017",Vacation Dinner,4,"While staying in Wellsboro for a couple nights we decided to eat here for dinner and we were very happy we did. My husband and I and 3 kids, ages 12,10 and 7. Kids were all happy with their food, I had a salad with chicken which was very good and really nice sized. My husband got steak and it came out pretty rare but the waitress quickly too it back and the second time it came out perfect. Our waitress was great.

The atmosphere was very setting for our anniversary dinner the place was decorated very nice and the lightening just added the touch! The waitress was very friendly and even helped us make our dinner choices with the questions we asked her and for me she sold her favorite meal by saying how delicious it was and darn she was right! I never saw my other half enjoy a steak like he did here with the steak tenderloins and he brags to everyone how the steak melted in his mouth! We never get dessert while out but decided to since the food was delicious so I go ahead and order the strawberry shortcake OH MY!!! here comes a big cup served with a warm delicious cake with strawberries and whip cream I was in heaven! This place was the right spot for our anniversary dinner!,506523448,885

My husband ordered the turkey platter and I had the sirloin. Though I ordered mine medium it came out beyond well done. Our waitress was more than happy to take it away and bring a medium one back for me.

29,"July 21, 2017",After a long wet day,4,On a recommend from the motel we stopped over for dinner. Three had steaks which were prepared as ordered and a nice size. One of our group had pasta which they said was good too. All in all a nice meal. I liked the bread pudding as house specialty. Our server was a bit confused but very friendly and very funny. We 'll enjoyed our meal,504214130,337

31,"July 10, 2017",So glad we finally tried this,5,"The Steak House will become a regular stop for us when we travel to Wellsboro. We knew about it but never tried before this past weekend. The food is really delicious and the setting is casual and comfortable. Steaks are tender, nice cuts trimmed of excess fat. The vegetables are cooked to perfection textures and flavored with nice herbs and spices combinations. The dessert that I tried was English Walnut pie, similar to Pecan pie. It was perfection! Our waitress shared that the owner bakes all day to prepare the pies and desserts at the restaurant and I really appreciated the delicious effort. We will be back for sure!",500536422,627

33,"July 10, 2017",Service and Selection are Excellent,5,"My husband and I were vacationing in Wellsboro and looked on Trip Advisor to see what restaurants were rated high. No. 1 on the list was The Steak House. How right they were. I am not one to go to steak houses, but this was a restaurant that carried a huge variety of selections in which to pick. I was so excited to see roast turkey on the menu, and they make their own pies. They had fried zucchini on the menu, and since I have a seafood allergy,I asked the waitress named Carolyn if the zucchini was deep fried in the same oil as they would do seafood. Carolyn went back and explained the situation, and they said that they sometimes do. She asked on her own if they would be able to fry it separately in a pan, and the chef was more than happy to do that for me. Carolyn was probably one of the best waitresses I have ever come across. If you want great customer service and delicious food, this is the place for you.",500361856,922
34,"July 10, 2017",Nice dinner,4,"My husband was not thrilled with his steak, but he can be rather picky. I enjoyed my crab cake and my dinner. It is a clean location and the wait staff is wonderful.",500316482,165
35,"July 3, 2017",Absolutely great food and excellent service!,5,"My family of 4 came in for dinner around 530PM. We were seated promptly, and the hostess even got a high chair for my youngest child right away. Our waitress took our drink and meal orders shortly after. My children shared a kids meal, and the waitress brought out one side (we ordered applesauce) for each of my kids to keep them from getting too hungry and antsy. Also we all received a loaf of fresh baked bread for our table! Our meals came out not too long after that and all of us finished our meals -- they were delicious! I want to say thank you for being so accommodating to a family with young children, your staff was great and even interacted with both of my children! :) I would most definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back again on our future trips to Wellsboro!",498407978,790
36,"June 29, 2017",Always amazing,5,Don't bother going to any other intown restaurant.. This is the place to go. You can't beat the delicious food or attentive service. Tabby was our server last night & she knows how to take care of her customers. As usual I ordered the luscious lamb steak & mint jelly. My husband had a filet mignon special. Both were done right & as tender as can be. Side dishes were done right. This is a nice little restaurant which has been in business for a very long time.,497106103,462
37,"June 25, 2017",Good Food but a Bit Pricy,3,"This is a typical pub, and the food, while good, was a bit pricy for what it was. We had the Sirloin/Shrimp. It was good, but not worth the nearly $30 price-tag. The strawberry rhubarb pie was very good.",495938492,203

This time I was trying to watch my calories so I ordered grilled chicken and it came with two sides. I was able to get a salad and green beans. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the seasoning used was delicious. I would dare say the best piece of chicken I have had. If I lived closer I would go for the chicken on a regular basis.,456251696,386
51,"January 14, 2017",Window Wonderland,5,"We were seated at the window facing Main Street which provided us with a front row seat of the falling snow! The service (friendly), food (chicken for my wife/steak for me), and ambiance (can't forget the nearby gas stove) were wonderful!",451909204,238
